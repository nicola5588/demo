_BitBucket + CodePipeline + S3 + Route 53 + CloudFront_

<b>Except that the region of ACM is us-east-1, all regions in this tutorial are ap-southeast-2</b>

# Step 1: Register domain in Route 53

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80022917/146707736-39c1be7b-129e-4523-9a9c-f919eb568390.png)

_For example: example.link_

Fill in details and register the domain

# Step 2: Create S3 buckets

a) Please ensure names of S3 buckets are exactly the same with your domain (example.link) and subdomain (www.example.link)

b) Select a region for your app (ap-southeast-2 is using for this tutorial)

c) Remain the rest and create the bucket

# Step 3: Change properties and permissions of S3 buckets

For the domain bucket (example.link):

Under the properties page, find the section Static website hosting and click Edit

![alt text](https://github.com/andy-she-hoi/AWS-CICD/blob/main/Image/s3_properties_1.jpg?raw=true)

Under the permissions page, find the section Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and click Edit

Attach CORS policy for the domain bucket
```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

For the subdomain bucket (www.example.link):

Under the properties page, find the section Static website hosting and click Edit

![alt text](https://github.com/andy-she-hoi/AWS-CICD/blob/main/Image/s3_properties_2.jpg?raw=true)

Please note that we do not need to edit Block public access (bucket settings) if we use Cloudfront

# Step 4: Create a CodePipeline

![alt text](https://github.com/andy-she-hoi/AWS-CICD/blob/main/Image/codepipeline_1.jpg?raw=true)

<b>If you do not own the Bitbucket repo, please create a User role in IAM for the repo owner, and ask the owner generate a connection</b>

_You can delete the user after the connection is generated._
 
<b>If you own the Bitbucket repo, click Connect to Bitbucket and then generate a connection</b>

Click the Create Project if needed

_The UI will change after you tick the box (Extract file before deploy)_

Review and create the pipeline

_Please note that the pipeline will not run successfully because the buildspec.yml file is not yet available_

# Step 5: Create the buildspec.yml

<b>Upload the buildspec.yml to the root directory of the master branch</b>

```
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 14
      
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Installing source NPM dependencies...
      - npm install
      
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - echo Compiling the Node.js code
      - npm run build
      
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`

# Include only the files required for your application to run.
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  discard-paths: no
  base-directory: build
```

# Step 6: Create a Hosted Zone

Create a Hosted zone that the name of the hosted zone matches your domain name.

Click into the Hosted zone just created and choose Create record.

Choose Switch to wizard.

Choose Simple routing, and choose Next.

Choose Define simple record.

In Record name, accept the default value, which is the name of your hosted zone and your domain.

In Value/Route traffic to, choose Alias to S3 website endpoint.

Choose the Region.

Choose the S3 bucket.

The bucket name should match the name that appears in the Name box. In the Choose S3 bucket list, the bucket name appears with the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the Region where the bucket was created

_for example, s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com (example.link)_

Choose S3 bucket lists a bucket if:

You configured the bucket as a static website.

The bucket name is the same as the name of the record that you're creating.

The current AWS account created the bucket.

In Record type, choose A ‐ Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources.

For Evaluate target health, choose No.

Choose Define simple record.

To add an alias record for your subdomain (www.example.com)

Under Configure records, choose Define simple record.

In Record name for your subdomain, type www.

In Value/Route traffic to, choose Alias to S3 website endpoint.

Choose the Region.

Choose the S3 bucket, _for example, s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com (example.link)_

In Record type, choose A ‐ Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources.

For Evaluate target health, choose No.

Choose Define simple record.

On the Configure records page, choose Create records.

# Step 7: Request a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager

DNS Validation
![alt text](https://github.com/andy-she-hoi/AWS-Frontend-CICD/blob/main/Image/acm.jpg?raw=true)

After the verification is successful, you will see that the status of your certificate becomes Issued, and there are 2 more records in the Hosted Zone of Route 53.

# Step 8: Create a distribution in CloudFront

# Step 9: Update records in Route 53

Under Records, select the type A record of your domain and subdomain.

Domain: example.link

![alt text](https://github.com/andy-she-hoi/AWS-CICD/blob/main/Image/hosted_zone_1.jpg?raw=true)

Subdomain: www.example.link
